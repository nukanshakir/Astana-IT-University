    "K-means clustering is a simple unsupervised machine-learning method for cluster analysis. The aim of the method is to partition a set of points into k clusters, such that each point is assigned to the nearest cluster. The algorithm iterates through two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid\n",

    "In this assignment, we will implement a much simplified version of the k-means clustering algorithm. Rather than running the algorithm until convergence, we will repeat the above two steps a large but fixed number of times. In addition, we will initialize only once, using a naive method according to which we randomly choose k points from the data to use as initial cluster centroids. \n",
    "\n",
